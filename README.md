ABSTRACT :

In regions abundant with wild animals such as elephants, tigers, and wild pigs, the delicate balance between human activity and wildlife presence poses a constant threat. Failure to
promptly detect oncoming wild animals can lead to life-threatening encounters, emphasizing the pressing need for an advanced surveillance and alert system. Traditional monitoring
methods, often manual or reliant on conventional cameras, fall short in providing timely alerts and accurate species identification. This project addresses these challenges by int-
roducing an intelligent surveillance system that leverages TensorFlow and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for enhanced monitoring capabilities.

The proposed system employs continuous video recording from strategically placed cameras, focusing on agricultural land and hilly terrains, to detect and predict the movement of 
wild animals. Successive frame differencing identifies moving objects, while TensorFlow extracts unique key features from a wildlife dataset. To overcome the critical challenge of 
species identification,the system utilizes Haar features to characterize moving objects. The collected data forms a robust training set, enabling accurate identification of elephan-
ts, tigers, and wild pigs in real-time images captured by the cameras.

This project is specifically tailored to address the challenges of human-wildlife interaction, emphasizing its relevance and applicability to this specific locale.The system aims to 
provide a targeted solution that aligns with the unique characteristics and requirements of the local environment. The projectâ€™s design and implementation take into consideration the 
specificneeds of the region, making it a bespoke solution that directly contributes to the conservation efforts and safety concerns within this geographical area. Through collaborat-
ion with the Govt of kerala, the project aims to enhance the effectiveness of wildlife monitoring, response mechanisms, and overall conservation strategies in this particular forest 
region.

Distinct modules for administrators, forest officers, and users have been integrated into the system. Administrators manage division and station information, animal databases, and 
complaint handling. Forest officers play an active role in monitoring, forwarding complaints, and receiving alerts, while users can register, lodge complaints,and access information 
about animals and notifications. This project not only represents an innovation in wildlife monitoring but also a comprehensive solution that combines technological advancements with
practical applications. The objective is to minimize the risks associated with human-animal interaction, providing timely alerts and fostering safer coexistence between humans and
wildlife in vulnerable regions. Through this intelligent surveillance system, we aim to reduce response times, mitigate potential dangers, and contribute to the conservation efforts 
of both human lives and wild species.
